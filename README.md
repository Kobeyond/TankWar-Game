Note:
1. The version of my IDE is Visual Studio2017, and before you start your project, you probably need to integrate the 'sfml' libs in your project. This step seems to be troublesome, you can refer to its webpage for more details: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php
2. If you wanna to build a deeper understanding about the project, or the structure of my codes, you can turn to the material of 'report.doc'. Everything is explained in detail there, you'll like it!
